# Reinforcement Learning With PyTorch and Pygame

**Built everything from scratch using Pygame and PyTorch.**
- Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q Learning are implemented.
- Snake game is made by Pygame library.
- Implemented the agent that controls the game.
- Implement the neural network to predict the moves and train it.

**To Run the project**
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run agent.py
